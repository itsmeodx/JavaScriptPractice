# JavaScript Practice

Learning JavaScript by actually building stuff instead of just watching tutorials.

## What I've Built

**Portal** - A simple landing page to keep all my projects organized in one place. Way better than digging through folders to find things.

**Console App** - A JavaScript console that runs in your browser. Type some code, hit enter, and see what happens. Includes command history and a live preview panel.

## Try It Out

Just clone and open the HTML files. No setup required.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itsmeodx/JavaScriptPractice.git
```
